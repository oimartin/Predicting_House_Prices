# Home Price EDA

## Examining Sale Price Data
The data gathered is from the Kaggle competition for House Prices â€“ Advanced Regression Techniques. I only worked with the training data set to create an EDA. The home sale price has a low selling price of $34,900, and a high selling price of $755,000. The sale price data is skewed to the left with the median price of $163,000 while the mean price is $180,921.20.

Missing home data was more related to a house not having a certain feature like a pool, so the PoolQC or pool quality was listed as NA. Most home features did not have any missing data, but about 20 features have NAs and lack a certain feature. PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, and Fence features had the most missing data or most house do not have pool, miscellaneous feature or a fence.

Analysis before standardizing data shows correlations between home sale price and the following features: a negative correlation between KitchenAbvGr, a positive correlation between OverallQual, a positive correlation between TotRmsAbvGrd, a positive correlation for good and excellent ExterQual, a positive correlation for finished GarageFinish, a negative correlation for typical ExterQual, and unfinished GarageFinish. These features were selected because they, initially, showed some stronger affects on the SalePrice data.

The training data was then grouped by the following features: GarageFinish,OverallQual, TotRmsAbvGrd, and KitchenAbvGr, and the following aggregate functions of SalePrice were used: min, max, mean, and median. The data was separately fitted and transformed with the StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler from scikitlearn and can be viewed in the jupyter notebook predicting_home_prices.
